# React Beauty Flags

**React Beauty Flags** is a React library that provides over **250 handcrafted SVG flags** — from countries to cities — designed to bring color and style to modern interfaces.

Born from frustration with dull or over-complicated alternatives, it focuses on **simplicity, visual harmony, and developer experience**.

    width={720}
    height={480}
    className="rounded-xl h-full max-h-[300px] md:max-h-[400px] object-contain show-animation"
    src={flagsOg}
  />
</figure>

## Motivation

After reusing flags in dozens of projects, I realized existing solutions were either too heavy or lacked design consistency. Inspired by **Duolingo’s clean and playful visuals**, I decided to design a set that looked great in any modern UI while staying developer-friendly.

> “I wanted something elegant enough for portfolios but simple enough to drop into production.”

The result is a **library now downloaded over 1,000 times** (and growing!) through NPM, with strong adoption among UI-focused developers and open-source enthusiasts.

## Highlights

* **+250 Handmade Flags** — Countries, cities, and symbols designed in Figma.
* **Lightweight & Fast** — Zero external dependencies, optimized SVGs.
* **Customizable** — Supports Tailwind utilities for borders, shadows, and radius.
* **Search & Filter** — Built-in search experience with sharable URLs.
* **TypeScript Ready** — Fully typed, autocompletion in your IDE.

  ### ⚙️ Automation Scripts

  **get-figma.ts** — Fetches SVGs from Figma via API and stores them locally.

  ```ts
  const response = await fetch(`${FIGMA_API_BASE}/files/${fileKey}`, {
    headers: { 'X-Figma-Token': FIGMA_API_TOKEN! },
  });

  const flagsPage = fileData.document.children.find(
    (page: any) => page.name === 'Flags' && page.type === 'CANVAS'
  );
  ```

  **build-flags.ts** — Optimizes SVGs with svgo, generates React components and enums.

  **check-flags.ts** — Validates flag consistency and missing metadata.

  ---

  ### 🚀 CI/CD Workflow

  Every push to `main` triggers GitHub Actions to:
  1. Fetch latest Figma flags
  2. Build & optimize assets
  3. Publish a new package version to NPM
  4. Deploy the demo site to Vercel automatically

  This workflow ensures the library is always up-to-date and deploys in under **2 minutes**.

## Website Overview

The [official website](https://flags.polgubau.com) — built with **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS** — showcases all flags with live filtering, previews, and instant code copy. Each flag includes:

* Interactive customization (radius, border, shadow)
* Copy-to-clipboard with prebuilt Tailwind classes
* Deep-linking via URL for easy sharing

## Lessons & Impact

Building **React Beauty Flags** reinforced my interest in **developer tooling and DX-first design**. Automating asset pipelines with TypeScript and Figma APIs improved my workflow, saving over **10 hours of manual flag updates per release**.

The project also sparked collaborations from other developers, who contributed designs and new scripts.

> Small details make software delightful — and flags, surprisingly, are one of them.

## Future Plans

* Add world organization and event flags
* Extend utility functions (color palettes, code matching)
* Add analytics on flag usage
* Improve accessibility metadata
