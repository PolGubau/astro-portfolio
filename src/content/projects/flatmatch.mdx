# Flatmatch - Find your ideal place to live

Flatmatch is a web app designed to help **Erasmus students and young professionals easily find short and mid term housing** across the world. Inspired by swipe-based apps like Tinder, but applied to the rental market, Flatmatch makes the housing search **fast, visual, and engaging**.

The concept is simple: swipe through listings until you find your match.

## Property Creation Flow

Publishing a property on Flatmatch is straightforward, broken down into **guided steps** to make sure every listing is accurate and attractive.

Instead of overwhelming users with a long form, the process is divided into **9 simple steps**:

1. **Property Type**

In this step, users select the type of property they are listing (e.g., apartment, shared room).

   <Image src={form_1type} alt="Select type of property" height={600} class={"show-animation rounded-2xl"} />

2. **Location**

In this step, users specify the location of the property, this is done with an autocomplete input powered by all streets in the world, selecting the desired street will automatically set the coordinates, postal code, city name and country name of the property so the user doesn't have to fill them manually.
   <Image src={form_2location} alt="Set location" height={600} class={"show-animation rounded-2xl"} />

3. **Commodities & Amenities**

In this step, users can select the amenities and commodities available in the property (e.g., Wi-Fi, kitchen, washing machine) Also the amount of bathrooms, bedrooms and the size of the property.
   <Image src={form_3commodities} alt="Choose amenities" height={600} class={"show-animation rounded-2xl"} />

4. **Company**

If the property is shared, the landlord can specify details about the current roommates living in the property and also if the landlord lives in the property.
   <Image src={form_4company} alt="Roommates and landlord details" height={600} class={"show-animation rounded-2xl"} />

5. **Metadata (Price, Size, etc.)**

In this step, users provide key details about the property, including its price, name, visible description, and upload photos to showcase the space.
   <Image src={form_5metadata} alt="Metadata form" height={600} class={"show-animation rounded-2xl"} />

6. **Tenant Preferences**

In this step, landlords can specify any preferences they have for potential tenants, such as age range, occupation, or gender.
   <Image src={form_6preferences} alt="Tenant preferences" height={600} class={"show-animation rounded-2xl"} />

   <Image src={form_7rules} alt="Set house rules" height={600} class={"show-animation rounded-2xl"} />

   <Image src={form_8timings} alt="Availability" height={600} class={"show-animation rounded-2xl"} />
