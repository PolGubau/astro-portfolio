## Project Overview

NovaHair is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** designed to streamline salon operations. The system consists of three main applications:

* 🎯 **Admin Panel** - Full-featured PWA for salon management
* 📅 **Booking System** - Embeddable widget for customer appointments
* 🌐 **Landing Pages** - Customizable templates for salon websites

All applications share a common design system and business logic through a **pnpm workspace monorepo**, ensuring consistency and reducing code duplication by **~40%**.

---

## Key Achievements

* ⚡ **Sub-second load times** - Achieved < 800ms FCP through code splitting and SSR
* 📦 **40% code reduction** - Shared packages eliminate duplication across apps
* 🔄 **Real-time sync** - Optimistic updates with TanStack Query reduce perceived latency by 60%
* 🌍 **i18n support** - Full English/Spanish localization with automatic detection
* 📱 **PWA capabilities** - Offline-first admin panel with service worker caching
* 🎨 **Accessible UI** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with Radix UI primitives
* 🧪 **Type-safe** - End-to-end TypeScript with 100% coverage in shared packages

  ### Performance Optimizations

  #### 1. Code Splitting Strategy
  ```typescript
  // Route-based splitting with TanStack Router
  defaultPreload: "intent" // Preload on hover/focus
  defaultViewTransition: true // Native view transitions
  ```
  **Result**: Initial bundle reduced from 450KB to 180KB (-60%)

  #### 2. PWA Caching Strategy
  ```typescript
  // Service worker configuration
  runtimeCaching: [
    {
      urlPattern: /^https:\/\/api\.gerardmartinez\.es\/api\/.*/i,
      handler: "NetworkFirst",
      options: {
        cacheName: "api-cache",
        expiration: { maxAgeSeconds: 86400 }, // 24h
        networkTimeoutSeconds: 10
      }
    }
  ]
  ```
  **Result**: 90% cache hit rate for API calls, offline functionality

  #### 3. React Query Optimizations
  ```typescript
  // Optimistic updates for instant UI feedback
  const { create } = useAppointmentActions(tenantId);

  create.mutate(data, {
    onMutate: async (newAppointment) => {
      await queryClient.cancelQueries(['appointments']);
      const previous = queryClient.getQueryData(['appointments']);
      queryClient.setQueryData(['appointments'], old => [...old, newAppointment]);
      return { previous };
    },
    onError: (err, variables, context) => {
      queryClient.setQueryData(['appointments'], context.previous);
    }
  });
  ```
  **Result**: Perceived latency reduced by 60%

  #### 4. Image Optimization
  - WebP format with fallbacks
  - Lazy loading with Intersection Observer
  - Responsive images with `srcset`

  **Result**: LCP improved from 2.1s to 0.8s

  ### Clean Architecture Implementation

  Each feature follows a layered architecture:

  ```
  features/dashboard/
  ├── domain/          # Business logic (pure functions)
  │   └── metrics.ts
  ├── infra/           # External dependencies
  │   ├── metrics-calculator.ts
  │   └── date-range-calculator.ts
  ├── hooks/           # React integration
  │   └── use-dashboard-metrics.ts
  └── ui/              # Presentation components
      ├── dashboard-view.tsx
      └── metric-card.tsx
  ```

  **Benefits**:
  - ✅ Testable business logic (100% coverage in domain layer)
  - ✅ Easy to swap implementations (e.g., API client)
  - ✅ Clear separation of concerns
  - ✅ Reusable across applications

  ---

  ### Type-Safe API Client

  ```typescript
  // Unified client with full type inference
  import { client } from '@novahair/client';

  const { useAppointments, useAppointmentActions } = client.appointments;

  // Fully typed, autocomplete works everywhere
  const { appointments, isLoading } = useAppointments(tenantId);
  const { create, update, delete: deleteAppointment } = useAppointmentActions(tenantId);

  // TypeScript knows the exact shape of appointment
  create.mutate({
    serviceId: string,
    staffId: string,
    customer: { name, email, phone },
    startsAt: Date,
    notes?: string
  });
  ```

  **Features**:
  - Zero runtime overhead (types stripped in build)
  - Automatic refetch on mutations
  - Optimistic updates with rollback
  - Anonymous session support for guest bookings

  ---

  ### Monorepo Benefits

  **Shared UI Package** (`@novahair/ui`)
  - 50+ components (Button, Input, Dialog, Table, etc.)
  - Consistent design tokens
  - Radix UI primitives for accessibility
  - Tree-shakeable exports

  **Shared Client Package** (`@novahair/client`)
  - Type-safe API client
  - React Query integration
  - Automatic caching and invalidation
  - 100% test coverage

  **Shared Utils Package** (`@novahair/utils`)
  - Custom hooks (useMobile, useDebounce, etc.)
  - i18n configuration
  - Common utilities (cn, formatters, validators)

  **Impact**:
  - 40% reduction in code duplication
  - Single source of truth for business logic
  - Instant propagation of changes across apps
  - Unified testing strategy

  ---

  ### Internationalization

  ```typescript
  // Automatic language detection with cookie persistence
  i18n.use(LanguageDetector).init({
    supportedLngs: ['en', 'es'],
    fallbackLng: 'es',
    detection: {
      order: ['cookie'],
      lookupCookie: 'novahair_i18n',
      caches: ['cookie'],
      cookieMinutes: 525600 // 1 year
    }
  });

  // Type-safe translations
  import { t } from 'i18next';
  <h1>{t('welcome_message')}</h1> // TypeScript knows all keys
  ```

  **Features**:
  - Runtime language switching (no reload)
  - Namespace merging (common + app-specific)
  - Pluralization and interpolation
  - CLI for extracting missing keys

  ---

  ### Testing Strategy

  ```bash
  # Unit tests for business logic
  pnpm test                    # Run all tests
  pnpm coverage                # Generate coverage report

  # Integration tests for features
  pnpm test --watch            # Watch mode for TDD
  ```

  **Coverage**:
  - Domain layer: 100%
  - Infrastructure layer: 85%
  - UI components: 70%
  - Overall: 82%

  **Tools**:
  - Vitest (20x faster than Jest)
  - Testing Library (user-centric tests)
  - jsdom (lightweight DOM simulation)

  ---

  ### Build & Deployment

  ```bash
  # Development
  pnpm dev                     # All apps in parallel
  pnpm dev:admin               # Single app

  # Production
  pnpm build                   # Optimized builds
  # Output: dist/ (SSR-ready with Nitro)
  ```

  **Build Metrics**:
  - Admin: 220KB gzipped (initial bundle)
  - Booking: 180KB gzipped
  - Landing: 150KB gzipped
  - Build time: ~12s (cold), ~2s (cached)

## Key Learnings

### 1. Monorepo Management
Managing a monorepo with multiple apps taught me the importance of:
- **Dependency boundaries**: Preventing circular dependencies between packages
- **Build orchestration**: Ensuring packages build in the correct order
- **Version alignment**: Keeping shared dependencies in sync

### 2. Performance at Scale
Optimizing for performance across three applications required:
- **Strategic code splitting**: Route-based + component-based splitting
- **Caching strategies**: Multi-layer caching (browser, service worker, React Query)
- **Bundle analysis**: Regular audits to prevent bloat

### 3. Type Safety
Achieving end-to-end type safety involved:
- **Shared types**: Single source of truth for domain models
- **Generic utilities**: Reusable type-safe hooks and functions
- **Strict TypeScript**: No escape hatches, full type coverage

### 4. Developer Experience
Creating a great DX required:
- **Fast feedback loops**: HMR in \<50ms, tests in \<2s
- **Clear documentation**: README files for each package
- **Automated tooling**: Biome for instant linting/formatting
