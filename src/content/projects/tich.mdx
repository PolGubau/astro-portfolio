# Tich - Private Class Tracker

**Tich** is a clean, minimal mobile app that helps private teachers track their students, classes, earnings and teaching hours.

It's split into three main sections:

## 📊 Dashboard

Provides a quick overview of your teaching stats:
- Total students
- Total classes taught
- Hours delivered
- Revenue earned

You also get a reverse-chronological list of all classes.
